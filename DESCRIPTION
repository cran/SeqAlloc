Description: Potential randomization schemes are prospectively evaluated when
    units are assigned to treatment arms upon entry into the experiment. The schemes
    are evaluated for balance on covariates and on predictability (i.e., how well
    could a site worker guess the treatment of the next unit enrolled).
